# SynthDeaf 


_Duration: 3 Week Sprint_

Directly above this is how long it took you to develop the project. Your project description goes here. What problem did you solve? How did you solve it? 

I designed SynthDeaf in 3 weeks, with a week of scope and 2 weeks of intensive programming. After discovering ToneJs, an audio library for javascript, I wanted to implement it into my solo project to combine my love of audio with my passion for developing web applications. To do so, I had to teach myself tonejs and integrate it with react, redux, sagas, node, sql in order to build a full stack app. It was a bear of a project, but I did it. The result is a web-based synthesizer/drum machine that can save, load, edit and delete presets. I’m happy with how this turned out, I hope you enjoy. 


### Prerequisites

Create a database called ‘solo_project’ (or whatever you want to call it) 
Run the database.sql file
Npm install 
Npm run server
Npm run client
Login and start tweaking

## Usage


1. Use the dropdowns to select your notes
2. Tweak with the wave type filter type, pattern, and bpm to your heart’s content. 
3.  Check the boxes to edit the drum sequence
4. Hit play! If you make changes you’ll have to stop and play again to apply them.
5. Make sure to have fun saving, editing and deleting your presets. Loading them is fun, the page autopopulates even.
